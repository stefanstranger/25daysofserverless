# 25daysofserverless
Repo to store 25daysofserverless challenges.

At Microsoft, they are very excited about serverless technologies and all the many ways people have of leveraging the cloud to scale their businesses. Microsoft Azure, for example, can “turn ideas into solutions with more than 100 services to build, deploy, and manage applications—in the cloud, on-premises, and at the edge—using the tools and frameworks of your choice.

Microsoft is launching 25 Days of Serverless as a way for you to explore – any way you like – the promise and potential of serverless technologies. Over the month of December, you’ll be able to tackle all kinds of challenges that you can solve any way you like; they will offer solutions built on Azure, of course, but they are curious how you would approach the problems we will present to you.
